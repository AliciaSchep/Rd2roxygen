Description: Functions to convert Rd to roxygen documentation. It can parse an
    Rd file to a list, create the roxygen documentation and update the original
    R script (e.g. the one containing the definition of the function)
    accordingly. This package also provides utilities which can help developers
    build packages using roxygen more easily. The formatR package can be used
    to reformat the R code in the examples sections so that the code will be
    more readable.
